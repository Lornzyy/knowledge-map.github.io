    <h1>ONLINE ADMISSION KNOWLEDGE MAP FOR FIRST YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF KENYA</h1>

    <h3>A knowledge map describes what knowledge is used in a process and how it flows 
        around the organization. <h5> - IBM GlobalServices - Technique Paper, 2000</h5></h3>
    <p>

        A knowledge map enables an organization to describe or have a view of the knowledge present within
        the organization, whether tacit or explicit, the infrastructure used to store it and lastly, how the information is disseminated. 
        Davenport and Prusak(1998), state that a knowledge map is the visual representation of important
        information in an organisation which has been located and it involves people, documents and databases. 
        It serves as the organisational memory as organisation continuously evolves and it captures and 
        integrates explicit knowledge within and without the organisation. 
        
        <br><br><i>According to the who, what and why of knowledge mapping by Wexler.</i> He explains 
        knowledge mapping as a medium of communication in identifying and locating what is important and 
        actionable information in an organisation therefore acting as a roadmap for them for the important  
        information. 
        Knowledge mapping allows an organisation to identify knowledge gaps within their knowledge and 
        promote knowledge flow, through promoting knowledge flow of an organisation, their knowledge management 
        capabilities improve such as their knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer  capabilities. 
        Which in turn assists the organisation in retaining the employees and gaining collaboration among 
        the employees (Somasundaram, 2022).
        <br><br>Knowledge mapping is also the visualization of a process or procedure to enable an organization to 
        identify its strength and weaknesses, and in the end enable the organization to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors.
        Where at times it is used as a review material of a procedure. An example, is when
        an organization implements a process or procedure they can use a knowledge map
        to know where they are hitches and implement strategies making it easier to identify any weaknesses.
        
        <br><br>Technical University of Kenya, is a University based in Kenya. Aimed to them offering higher education and research in technology 
        which align with the Technical University of Kenya mission of providing technological education 
        and training and to contribute to the advancement of society through research and innovation.
        
        <br><br>Conventionally The Technical University of Kenya used to perform physical admission for the 
        first year undergraduate students. However, due to the advancement of technology and the Corona 
        virus pandemic the school implemented the online admission. This made the process fast and reduced the 
        physical contact of students therefore protecting the incoming, current students and the staff from the pandemic.
        
        <br><br>
        Our main aim is to provide the first years with a guide of what is involved in the admission process so that they are not 
        confused and scared of the admission process. This will help them finish up the process fast and create time to start learning and also avoid redundant questions to the school.

        We were able to interview key players in the process who helped us understand it and finally be able to produce the knowledge map. 
        

        <br> Below is the procedural knowledge map we were able to come up with:
