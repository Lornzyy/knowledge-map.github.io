        ONLINE ADMISSION KNOWLEDGE MAP FOR FIRST YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT
        THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF KENYA
      </h1>

      <h3>
        A knowledge map describes what knowledge is used in a process and how it
        flows around the organization.
        <h5>- IBM GlobalServices - Technique Paper, 2000</h5>
      </h3>
      <p>
        A knowledge map enables an organization to describe or have a view of
        the knowledge present within the organization, whether tacit or
        explicit, the infrastructure used to store it and lastly, how the
        information is disseminated.

        <br /><br /><i>Davenport and Prusak</i> state that a knowledge map is
        the visual representation of important information in an organisation
        which has been located and it involves people, documents and databases.
        It serves as the organisational memory as organisation continuously
        evolves and it captures and integrates explicit knowledge within and
        without the organisation.

        <br /><br />
        <i>According to the who, what and why of knowledge mapping by Wexler.</i>
        He explains knowledge mapping as a medium of communication in
        identifying and locating what is important and actionable information in
        an organisation therefore acting as a roadmap for them for the important
        information.

        <br /><br />Knowledge mapping is also the visualization of a process or
        procedure to enable an organization to identify its strength and
        weaknesses, and in the end enable the organization to gain a competitive
        advantage over its competitors. Where at times it is used as a review
        material of a procedure. <br /><br />An example, is when an organization
        implements a process or procedure they can use a knowledge map to know
        where they are hitches and implement strategies making it easier to
        identify any weaknesses.

        Below is the procedural knowledge map for first year government sponsored
        undergraduate students we were able to come up with:

        <br /><br />The Technical University of Kenya, is a University based in
        Kenya. They aim to offer higher education and research in
        technology which align with its mission of providing technological
        education and training and to contribute to the advancement of society
        through research and innovation.

        <br /><br />Conventionally, the Technical University of Kenya used to
        perform physical admission for the first year undergraduate students.
        However, due to the Corona virus pandemic which required for reduction
        in physical contact. The school implemented online admission which was
        made possible by the advancement of technology. This made the process
        fast and reduced the physical contact of students therefore protecting
        the incoming, current students and the staff from the pandemic.

        </p>
        <h2> How do students perform the online admission?</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Government Sponsored students</h3>

        <p>
        KUCCPS gets to shortlist the students that are to be admitted into the
        school. Despite the fact that KUCCPS plays the major role in choosing
        the students that the school will admit, the institution still has a say
        in the number of students to be admitted. This is referred to as the
        declared capacity per class.
        <br><br>
        In their case, all the institution does is
        to provide the shortlisted students with admission letters. Once they
        receive their letters, they can begin their uploading of their documents
        online. The gap the team identified was, some of the students do not
        know how to use computers, therefore they may have trouble uploading
        them. For those that know their way around the websites, they get to do
        their online application. 
        <br><br>
        Once it is complete, the students receive a
        notification saying they have completed it. The coordination of the
        admission process is done by the academic registrar. The students are
        then admitted by the deans committee and the senate.

        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Self-sponsored Students</h3>

        <p>
        The process of admission tends to be longer, since the students apply for whichever course 
        they are interested in. 
        <br><br>The institution receives the applications and each is 
        forwarded to the respective schools and faculty. The school shortlists the students 
        depending on the criteria decided upon. Once the students have been shortlisted, 
        the deans committee admits the ones that got through. This is also done by the senate. 
        <br><br>Finally, the students are registered by the registrar's department.
        After this the students can now be given a student portal to operate with and they are now 
        considered students of the university. -->


        <p><br /><br />The knowldge map describes the online admission of first
        year undergraduate students at Technical University of Kenya, from the
        start to up until the student is done and can now attend lectures.The
        knowledge maps helped us understand the process and we were able to
        determine that the most prominent challenge was computer illiteracy.
        <br /><br />
        Whereby, the students who do not know their way around computers have a
        hard time with the admission. To combat this we thought making a
        knowledge map will easen the process, when a student is stuck they can
        follow the map and see where they are at and what the next step is.
        
        <br>This will help give them a footing of what they should do and avoid
        being confused and loathing the process. Additionally, the knowledge map
        will easen the inquiries since they will have the knowledge map will
        answer their questions.
